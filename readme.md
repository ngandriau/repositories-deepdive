# Spring Data Repositories - A Deep Dive

This repository contains the sample code for the _"Spring Data Repositories - A deep dive"_ presentation that demonstrates the feature of the Spring Data repositories abstraction in detail.

The repository is not a continuous one in the classical sense. Every commit represents a step in the presentation and implements a new requirement as the code continues to grow.

__Attention:__ Expect the repository to be rebased at any time as changes to the codebases have to be applied to the commit the relevant code was introduced.
